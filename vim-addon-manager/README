This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2905

NEW: Windows users can use this download form now: http://mawercer.de/~marc/vam/index.php to get plugins.

Note:
There is also  http://packages.debian.org/sid/vim-addon-manager
which servers a similar purpose but is Debian specific.
I chose the same name by accident. See doc/*

usage example:

set runtimepath+=~/path-to/vim-plugin-manager
call scriptmanager#Activate(["vim-haxe","The_NERD_tree","vim-latex"])

On startup you'll have to confirm installing plugins.
For reviewing plugins before usage try :InstallAddon command which downloads only

Note: I setup a cron job which updates the 
vim-plugin-manager-known-repositories every couple of days.

Detailed description can be found in the doc directory of this distribution.
